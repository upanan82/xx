## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The recommended Node version: `v8.11.3`

Install dependencies:

    yarn i

### 1. Run the _WEB_ app

Start development live-reload server:

    yarn web

Start production server:

    yarn web-bundle

### 2. Run the _mobile_ App

Download the [Expo](https://expo.io/) application on your phone.
Make sure your phone is in the same network as your computer.

Start development live-reload server:

    yarn start


#### 1. Clone and Install

_*It's recommended that you install [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases) and open before `yarn start`._

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-kit.git

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

#### 2.1. Run the _React Native_ App

```bash
# Start the React Native packager
yarn start
```

Instructions are shown in the terminal. You can select to open it in:

- An emulator (either iOS or Android)
- Your mobile device with the [Expo app](https://expo.io/). It will reload if you save edits to your files and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### 2.2. Run the _Web_ App

```bash
# Starts are local live-reload server at:
# http://localhost:3001
yarn run web
```

Via webpack, starts a localhost server on port 3001 [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

- Save code and it auto refreshes
- Install [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) into Chrome to see the state of Redux
